		GhenInSpaceHigh = The scarred rock far below looks as if it were stripped away by ages of impacts. The thing is, you're not sure if the impacts were natural or not...
		GhenInSpaceLow = The broken, eroded surface of Ghen flies past at an alarming rate. You wonder idly if the orbit is high enough while looking for landing spots inside of its huge gashes.
		GhenLandedLesserRifts = It's so dark, even with the lights on.
		GhenLandedGrandRift = At least the canyon stops somewhere.
		GhenLandedGrandBasin = The dark plains extend in all directions, silent and forever unlit.

		GhenLandedNilpeGheniPixa = You have the high ground. You've won.
		GhenLandedFarsideSlashes = It's wild, really, how deep these little canyons are on a world which appears to have always been bone-dry.
		GhenLandedFarsidePlains = The inky black extends endlessly over the surface.
		GhenLandedSouthernRend = You are shocked to discover that this is, in fact, yet another depression in Ghen's far side.
		GhenLandedPoles = The poles are rather flat and rather bland, but show clear signs that the sun shone at least once here.
		GhenLandedStain = The discolored, depressed flat extends everywhere. You can feel the heat already.
		GhenLandedSolarImperfections = These plains remind you of wind-blown sand. Stunning, but there're probably better places for a vacation home.
		GhenLandedSolarPlains = These plains remind you of wind-blown sand. Stunning, but there're probably better places for a vacation home.
		GhenLandedSolarFlaw = The surface here is scarred by some long-forgotten impact of sorts. You wonder when this happened and why it wasn't just baked away in the leat of Lauhel'Saal.

		GhenLandedLesserRifts = The stars far above are a welcome, beautiful sight in the immense darkness.
		GhenLandedGrandRift = The sides of the rift isolate you and your craft from nearly any outside influences. This would be a nice campsite.
		GhenLandedGrandBasin = It looks flat enough around here, but it's difficult to tell what other surface features exist around.
		GhenLandedGrandHeights = You can't tell where the canyon starts. It'd be wise not to stray towards any slanting edges.
		GhenLandedNilpeGheniPixa = You shout into the huge rifts below that it's over; you have the high ground.
		GhenLandedFarsideSlashes = The stars far above are a welcome, beautiful sight in the immense darkness.
		GhenLandedFarsidePlains = You are unsure which way would bring you towards a notable sight on this dark side.

		GhenLandedPoles = The endless sunrises and sunsets would be a lot safer if you hadn't left the ship.
		GhenLandedStain = The blazing heat forces you to rush your EVA report.
		GhenLandedSolarImperfections = You question why you left the craft.
		GhenLandedSolarPlains = This was a bad idea.

		GhenInSpaceHigh = Predictably, there is no atmosphere here to detect. A sad truth, but it's nice to know that the cosmic ether doesn't exist.
		GhenInSpaceLow = Nope, not even a lick of air. It would have been very nice to see an atmosphere here, but it doesn't appear there is.
		GhenLandedLesserRifts = There is a harsh vacuum here. Maybe a few atoms of gas, but that doesn't count.
		GhenLandedGrandRift = Deep in the rift, an extremely tenuous mix of gas is apparent. It's nearly undetectable, but it's enough for R&D to salivate over.

		GhenLandedGrandHeights = There is a harsh vacuum here. Maybe a few atoms of gas, but that doesn't count.

		GhenInSpaceHigh = The scanner sweeps over Ghen, revealing a relatively high gravity for the tiny planet's unassuming size.
		GhenInSpaceLow = A large surge of gravioli particles invalidates the warranty of the device and indicates Ghen's impressive density.
		GhenLandedLesserRifts = Even from within this rift, the scanner still indicates most of the gravity coming from below.
		GhenLandedGrandRift = Even from within this massive rift, the scanner still indicates most of the gravity coming from below.
		GhenLandedGrandBasin = Yep, there's gravity. It is definitively higher than expected for a body smaller than the Mun.

		GhenLandedLesserRifts = The goo does something scientifically interesting, but it is too dark to tell what.

		GhenLandedLesserRifts = The dense rock deep in these rifts requires the use of a pick to gather a sample of. It appears to contain tungsten, but at notably higher concentrations than usual.
		GhenLandedGrandRift = You pick up a small bit of loose rock and are shocked by its relative weight. Upon analysis, the rock down here looks to be a high-purity tungsten ore!
		GhenLandedGrandBasin = The loose, sandy stones reflect your headlights with a vigor which you deem insulting. They contain tungsten at a modest concentration.
		GhenLandedGrandHeights = A sample of the brown sand looks, feels, and scans as relatively mundane.
		GhenLandedNilpeGheniPixa = You cannot help but assert to the sample that you have the high ground. The sand itself appears to be some sort of blasted sediment from either heavy impacts or excavation.
		GhenLandedFarsideSlashes = The tough rock here looks to contain tungsten. Neat, but not very interesting.
		GhenLandedFarsidePlains = The loose rock and sand here looks as if it were blown here from somewhere else and contains tiny traces of solar particles and tungsten.
		GhenLandedSouthernRend = Gravel to a mundane degree. It is quite dense and fun to toss around.
		GhenLandedPoles = The half-baked stone here is rather curious, seeing that it only suffers Lauhel'Saal's purifying light during a single time of the Ghenian year.
		GhenLandedStain = This oddly discolored stone appears to contain an unknown element intermeshed with the veins of tungsten ore.
		GhenLandedSolarImperfections = The ground here is hard, fused together into a glassy sort of mixture which resists your tools. Instead of struggling for long in the horrifying heat, you simply pick up a stone.
		GhenLandedSolarPlains = The heat has practically melted the ground into one continuous mass.
		GhenLandedSolarFlaw = Here, the cracked "soil" looks to contain traces of tungsten ores just like the rest of Ghen.
