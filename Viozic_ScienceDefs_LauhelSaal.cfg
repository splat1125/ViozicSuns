		GhenInSpaceHigh = The scarred rock far below looks as if it were stripped away by ages of horrific impacts.
		GhenInSpaceLow = The stained surface of Ghen cruises below your craft.
		GhenSrfLandedGrandRift = It is very dark, but at least the stars are here to keep you company.
		GhenSrfLandedGrandBasins = You feel like you're in a dream. The deep darkness is certainly something to behold.
		GhenSrfLandedGrandLowlands = The craft sits atop pure blackness.
		GhenSrfLandedGrandPeriphery = You wish the sun would shine here just so you could see the rifts and basins.
 		GhenSrfLandedPoles = Lauhel'Saal is nearly always visible here and it is terrifying.
		GhenSrfLandedQuarry = These cliffs sure are steep...
		GhenSrfLandedPeripheralLowlands = The craft sits atop pure blackness.
		GhenSrfLandedPeripheralScarring = The walls of these scars blot out most of the craft's surroundings. You can't see too much.
		GhenSrfLandedIslands = You hope the landing gear holds up.
		GhenSrfLandedPeripheralHighlands = Far above the inky black surroundings, you feel triumphant.
		GhenSrfLandedStain = The surface here is flat, dark, and eerie. You wonder how such a stain like this could form.
		GhenSrfLandedFlaws = The land here is just a tad below its surroundings.
		GhenSrfLandedBrightlands = Flat, boring land all around.
		GhenSrfLandedDimlands = The soil here looks slightly dark and extremely boring.
		GhenSrfLandedMinorCraters = The tiny divet refuses to supply very much shade. You presume it will be very warm out there.
		GhenSrfLandedMajorCraters = The huge crater around you cradles the craft. 
		GhenSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Stripes in a sea of brown. They look sort of re-melted from in here.

		GhenInSpaceHigh = Your suit sounds a quiet alarm at the rising heat. It may be wise to go back into the ship soon.
		GhenInSpaceLow = As you near the planet, you become less and less confident that landing is a good idea.
		GhenSrfLandedGrandRift = My God, it's full of stars.
		GhenSrfLandedGrandBasins = You feel like you're stuck in a starry limbo.
		GhenSrfLandedGrandLowlands = It's somewhat fun to jump so high here.
		GhenSrfLandedGrandPeriphery = You hope the edge isn't anywhere near you.
 		GhenSrfLandedPoles = All it takes is one look out at Lauhel'Saal for you to realize just how small you are.
		GhenSrfLandedQuarry = This... quarry feels far too quiet to overlook. It's clearly artificial...
		GhenSrfLandedPeripheralLowlands = 
		GhenSrfLandedPeripheralScarring = 
		GhenSrfLandedIslands = This bit of land rising just a bit above the surrounding basin makes you feel important.
		GhenSrfLandedPeripheralHighlands = 
		GhenSrfLandedStain = Your suit heats up slowly as you wander over the flats. The dark ground apparently captures a lot of solar radiation.
